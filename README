This website utualizes MySQL and PHP on the server side. It is intended to work on a standard LAMP setup. You will have to set up a MySQL database, perhaps trough PHPMyAdmin, with a name of your choice. This database name along with your username and password to the database has to be entered correctly in the ./lib/libAuth.php files makeMySQLConnection() function. 


To set up the requiered database tables, run the fallowing SQL to create the first needed table:

CREATE TABLE `<insert database name here>`.`users` (
`email` VARCHAR( 128 ) NOT NULL ,
`password` VARCHAR( 32 ) NOT NULL ,
`active` TINYINT( 1 ) NULL ,
PRIMARY KEY ( `email` )
) ENGINE = MYISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COMMENT = 'The table containing the site administrators and their encrypted passwords';


And the second table:

CREATE TABLE `<insert database name here>`.`pages` (
`index` TINYINT NOT NULL COMMENT 'A unique number, the order of links',
`title` TEXT NOT NULL COMMENT 'The shown title',
`JStitle` TEXT NOT NULL COMMENT 'The cleaned title for code',
PRIMARY KEY ( `index` )
) ENGINE = MYISAM COMMENT = 'The table containing the pages of the website';


And the third table:

CREATE TABLE  `<insert database name here>`.`verification` (
`email` VARCHAR( 64 ) NOT NULL COMMENT  'The email adress',
`token` VARCHAR( 32 ) NOT NULL COMMENT  'The verification code'
) ENGINE = MYISAM COMMENT =  'Table used for verifying accounts';


This project depends on mcrypt for email validation. It has to be installed to the system and enabled in php.ini.


After that you should visit pages/register.php to register your administrational account. After the first account is registered, you must be logged in to an account with sufficent privileges to add additional accounts.





The fallowing table is included for documentational purposes soely, it will be automaticly be created for each page that is added to the website

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `<page name>` (
  `index` tinyint(4) NOT NULL COMMENT 'The order of posts',
  `type` tinyint(2) NOT NULL COMMENT 'The type of the content',
  `title` text CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin COMMENT 'The title of the post',
  `JStitle` text CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin COMMENT 'The cleaned title',
  `content` text CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin COMMENT 'The content of the post',
  `parent` text CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin COMMENT 'The parent of the object',
  PRIMARY KEY (`index`),
  UNIQUE KEY `JStitle` (`JStitle`(50))
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

Register over the different types of entries:

0 - A title and hidden paragraph that is opened by clicking on the paragraph.
1 - Open and Close all buttons for the hidden paragraphs.
2 - A title or paragraph, or both. Heck why not two of them both!
3 - An image with caption.
4 - A title with hidden objects underneath, such as those of the type 0 and 2.
